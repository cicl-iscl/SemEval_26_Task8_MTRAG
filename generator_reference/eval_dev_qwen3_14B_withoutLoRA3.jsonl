Regardless, what you are asking is not generally practical nor does it come into practice in 99 out of 100 financing situations. WACC is important to understand and consider but people don't issue equity or debt just to balance their WACC. Think about this another way... how easy is it to raise debt? Probably fairly easy as usually you can go to commercial banks or go to an investment bank if you're raising enough debt. Companies borrow all of the time, they're constantly paying off loans or taking new ones with different interest rates. There are revolving lines of credit, secured loans, factoring (borrowing against receivables), EETCs, fixed interest debt, variable interest debt, mezzanine debt, etc etc. How easy is it to issue equity?

Your safest bet is to grow organically. This means having a business model with negligible start-up costs and little overhead costs. Your inventory is going to be small and because of that, your margins are going to be thin (no wholesale prices).

It is essential to learn how to do the job and don't be afraid to step in and help out. If you never do this people will assume you think you're too good to do the work they do and they won't respect you or your authority. Being good at something gives you natural authority and people will seek you out for advice/direction. Trust your employees to do their jobs until they prove otherwise. Management is a relationship and relationships are based on trust. A manager should be much more aware of how each person contributes to the whole, what their strengths are, who to talk to about what, and how, and why.

Non-profits love to attract donations by saying the money is tax deductible, but for most people, it doesn't work out that way. You will only itemize deductions if they exceed your standard deduction. The IRS allows you to either \"\"itemize\"\" your deductions (where you list each deduction you can take) or take the \"\"standard deduction\"\". Consider a married couple filing jointly in 2011. Their standard deduction is $11,400. They are in the 28% tax bracket. They donate $100 of old clothes to the Goodwill, and are looking forward to deducting that on your taxes, and getting $28 of that back. If that's their only deduction, though, they'd have to give up the standard deduction to take the itemized deduction. Not worth it. Suppose instead they have $11,500 of deductions in 2011. Now we're talking, right? No. The tax impact of itemizing is only $28, since they only exceeded the standard deduction by $100. The cost of having a tax accountant fill out the itemization form probably offsets that small gain. There's also all the time that went in to tracking those deductions over the year. Not worth it.  Tax deductions only become worthwhile when they significantly exceed the standard deduction. You need some big ticket items to get past the itemized deduction threshold. For most people, this only happens when they have a mortgage, as the interest on a residence is deductible.  Folks love to suggest that having a mortgage is a good deal, because the interest is deductible. However, since you have to exceed the standard deduction before it makes sense to itemize, it's not likely to be a big win.

There are several downsides to this strategy: You aren't taking into account commissions. If you pay $5 each time you buy or sell a stock, you may greatly reduce or even eliminate any possible gains you would make from trading such small amounts. This next point sounds obvious, but remember that you pay a commission on every trade regardless of profit, so every trade you make that you make at a loss also costs you commissions. Even if you make trades that are profitable more often than not, if you make quite a few trades with small amounts like this, your commissions may eat away all of your profits. Commissions represent a fixed cost, so their effect on your gains decreases proportionally with the amount of money you place at risk in each trade. Since you're in the US, you're required to follow the SEC rules on pattern day trading.

If you can't maintain the balance, your account will be locked. Don't forget about capital gains taxes. Since you're holding these securities for less than a year, your gains will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rates. You can deduct your capital losses too (assuming you don't repurchase the same security within 30 days, because in that case, the wash sale rule prevents you from deducting the loss), but it's important to think about gains and losses in real terms, not nominal terms. The story is different if you make these trades in a tax-sheltered account like an IRA, but the other problems still apply. You're implicitly assuming that the stock's prices are skewed in the positive direction.

Determining whether you are a resident is somewhat complex, and there is not enough information in your question to determine it. Publication 519 is the guide for taxes for aliens. (It hasn't been updated for 2014 yet, so mentally shift all the years in the publication up by one year when you read it.) Since you don't have a green card, whether you are a resident is determined by the Substantial Presence Test. The test says that if (the number of days you were in the U.S. in 2014) + 1/3 of (the number of days you were in the U.S. in 2013) + 1/6 of (the number of days you were in the U.S. in 2012) >= 183 days (half a year), then you are a resident alien for 2014.

Students are not \"\"exempt individuals\"\" for a year if they have been exempt individuals for any part of 5 previous calendar years. (Different exceptions apply for teachers and trainees.)

Your home country may also decide to apply sanctions to the country in which you are invested thus making it impossible to get your money back even though the foreign country will allow you to redeem them or sell. Diplomatic relations and trade agreements tend to be difficult.

I can tell from your post that you think like an investor.  It is highly unlikely that the entrepreneurial programmers that you will be backing will be wired that way.   From the modest amount that you are investing, you are unlikely to be the lead investor in this opportunity.

If speed limit signs are posted for a lower limit than is considered reasonable, many drivers will simply ignore the signs. At the same time, other drivers will stay within the posted limits.

The facts indicate otherwise. Research conducted in many parts of this country over a span of several decades has shown that drivers are influenced more by the appearance of the highway itself and the prevailing traffic conditions than by the posted speed limit.

All other speed limits are called prima facie limits, which \"on the face of it\" are safe and prudent under normal conditions. Certain prima facie limits are established by law and include the 25 MPH limit in business and residential districts, the 15 MPH limit in alleys, at blind intersections and blind railroad crossings and a part-time 25 MPH limit in school zones when children are going to and from school.

You may even ask for\r\n mediation\r\n the day of your trial.\n\nConsider Mediation\n\r\n An alternative to formal litigation in the court \r\n is the use of a mediator to resolve Small Claims disputes. All parties \r\n must mutually agree to mediation, and the formal rules of court do not apply to \r\n the mediation process.

The Small Claims Mediation and Advisory Services provides legal \r\n advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\r\n If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a \r\n dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court \r\n review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no \r\n right of appeal. So if you should lose, that is probably the end of the case. \r\n However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. \r\n When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again.\r\n \n\nLocation and Telephone Number\n\r\n The \r\n Carol Miller Justice Center is located at 301 \r\n Bicentennial Circle.

A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn\u2019t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts.

For example, several wholesalers and a set of farmers might be joined to a single channel. If a farmer and a wholesaler want to transact privately, they can create a channel for this purpose. But they can also decide to create a private data collection on the smart contract that governs their business interactions to maintain privacy over sensitive aspects of the sale, such as the price, without having to create a secondary channel. To learn more about when to use private data within a blockchain, visit the [Private Data](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data/private-data.htmlprivate-data) concept article in the Fabric documentation.\n\nIn order to use private data with IBM Blockchain Platform, the following three conditions must be satisfied:\n\n\n\n1. Define the private data collection. A private data collection file can be added to your smart contract. Then, at run time, your client application can use private data-specific chaincode APIs to input and retrieve data from the collection. For more information about how to use private data collections with your smart contract, see the Fabric SDK tutorial on [Using private data](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-private-data.html) in the Fabric SDK documentation.\n2.

These regions share the same range of latitudes, so their view of the night sky is similar.We recommend using skywatching apps for mobile devices and computers for determining if something can be seen from your location, and when to look for it. They enable you to enter your location on Earth and see the sky as it will look on a particular date and time.How big is a \"degree\" when describing how close objects appear in the sky? A degree is about the with of your little finger held at arm's length. Most of us are familiar with the idea that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that making a 180-degree turn is to face the opposite direction. If you imagine the sky as a sphere with the stars fixed onto it and pick any point, and draw a circle all the way around the sky until you return to that point, you will have rotated through 360 degrees.

Remember to also use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time during a solar eclipse when it\u2019s safe to look at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun\u2019s bright face. Ask an adult for help looking at the Sun.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen somewhere around the world about once a year. But because the Moon casts a fairly small shadow, these eclipses can only be seen from a small area on Earth each time.\nOther things can also pass between us and the Sun and block some of its light. When this happens, it is called a transit. Different things like planets, comets, spacecraft, and even birds can transit the Sun.\n\nHow to Play\nThe goal of this game is to snap photos of eclipses and objects that transit the Sun.

Eclipse glasses are NOT the same as regular sunglasses; regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the Sun. During a total solar eclipse, you must wear your eclipse glasses (or use other solar filters) to view the Sun directly during the partial eclipse phase. You can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun \u2013 known as the period of totality. If you don\u2019t have eclipse glasses, you can use an indirect viewing method, such as a pinhole projector, which projects an image of the Sun onto a nearby surface.It is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during all types and during all stages of a lunar eclipse.Learn MoreA family wearing eclipse glasses watches the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017.", "title": "Eclipses - NASA Science", "score": 16.371933, "feedback": {"relevant": {"42d17c67-ece3-461d-be45-ac59f3912c73": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1722020192}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "eclipse glasses"}}}}}}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "Name the sources of light pollution that affect skywatching.", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "42d17c67-ece3-461d-be45-ac59f3912c73", "created_at": 1722018160}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "Light pollution is caused by stray light from various human activities, including parking lots, sport complexes, street lights, and other sources.

This can be done for several reasons; usually the primary reason is that the terms of the new loan will result in a lower monthly payment. Debt consolidation (taking out one big loan at a relatively low interest rate to pay off the smaller, higher-interest loans that rack up, like credit card debt, medical bills, etc) is a form of refinancing, but you most commonly hear the term when referring to refinancing a home mortgage, as in your example. To answer your questions, most of the money comes from a new bank. That bank understands up front that this is a re-fi and not \"\"new debt\"\"; the homeowner isn't asking for any additional money, but instead the money they get will pay off outstanding debt. Therefore, the net amount of outstanding debt remains roughly equal. Even then, a re-fi can be difficult for a homeowner to get (at least on terms he'd be willing to take). First off, if the homeowner owes more than the home's worth, a re-fi may not cover the full principal of the existing loan. The bank may reject the homeowner outright as not creditworthy (a new house is a HUGE ding on your credit score, trust me), or the market and the homeowner's credit may prevent the bank offering loan terms that are worth it to the homeowner. The homeowner must often pony up cash up front for the closing costs of this new mortgage, which is money the homeowner hopes to recoup in reduced interest; however, the homeowner may not recover all the closing costs for many years, or ever. To answer the question of why a bank would do this, there are several reasons: The bank offering the re-fi is usually not the bank getting payments for the current mortgage. This new bank wants to take your business away from your current bank, and receive the substantial amount of interest involved over the remaining life of the loan.", "score": 16.542427, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1722941417}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "|user|: When applying for a mortgage, can it also cover outstanding debts?\n|assistant|: The documents do not provide an answer to the question.\n|user|: Is refinancing the same as getting a mortgage?"}}}}}}, {"document_id": "274870-0-1888", "text": "\n\"Mortgage is a (secured) debt, a combination of a promissory note, and a security interest providing the mortage holder a secured interest in the property.

But that depends upon whether you define the term \"\"in debt\"\" as a debt appearing on the balance sheet, or the net of assets - liabilities is less than zero, whether you have a \"\"debt\"\" expense on the income statement (budget), or whether the net of income - expenses is less than zero. One person might look at their budget, find the (monthly) mortgage payment listed, and judge that they have a debt payment, and thus are \"\"in debt\"\".

Trust me, having a high mortgage payment (higher 30% of your net income) is hard, and over 40% is bad. Consider you balance sheet and your income statement.

As such, the bank isn't an \"\"investor\"\" in your house; it simply is lending you money with the property as collateral. So, it doesn't get any share of the profit. As long as you sell the house on your own, for more than you owe, most of the time in the US you will get about 92-94% of the sale price back, minus whatever you owe on the house. The 6-8% you don't get will go to the realtors as commission (unless you sell by owner and don't sell to someone with a buyer's agent), and to pay some of the costs of the sale (how much of those you pay depends on the deal you make with the buyer, but it's common to pay some of them in some areas). You also will owe taxes (potentially). You then pay the bank back from that amount. As such, in your example, let's say Bob owes $50k on his house, and sells it with a realtor for $150k. He gets $150k-0.06*150k = 141k after commission. He then hands the bank a check for the current payoff of the loan: that amount is usually slightly higher than the remaining principal, because you owe the interest that's accrued between [last payment you made] and [day of sale]. Let's say this is a 6% loan, which works out to around 0.5% per month, and it's been half a month since his last payment, so he owes another 0.25%, or another $125. Some mortgages also may have prepayment penalties (check your note). In this case there isn't a penalty, so the bank gets $50,125 from the sale. Usually, the bank would get that immediately at closing - ie, he doesn't get the full $141k or $150k and then write a check, instead the title/closing company gets that amount, and gives the $9k to the realtors, the $50,125 to the bank, and the remaining $90,875 to him.", "score": 18.931376, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1722941412}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "What is a mortgage?"}}}}}}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "When applying for a mortgage, can it also cover outstanding debts?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c", "created_at": 1722939556}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "The documents do not provide an answer to the question.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1722939559}}, {"speaker": "user", "text": "Is refinancing the same as getting a mortgage?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c", "created_at": 1722940886}}], "targets": [{"speaker": "agent", "text": "No, they are not the same.

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match.

Create and configure backup accounts as code.\n\n\n\n\n\n Backup accounts \n\nEach BU account group should include a separate backup account and an additional backup account should be used for the centralized accounts.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

Pile conditions within that range will promote rapid decomposition and destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Above that temperature range, beneficial microorganisms cannot survive. Below that range, decomposition will occur more slowly, and pathogens and weed seeds may remain in the final compost. Pile temperatures must remain at 131 degrees Fahrenheit or above for several days to meet standards for reducing pathogens. The exact amount of time depends on the method of composting. Controlling the oxygen, moisture, pile structure, and nutrient balance helps achieve the optimal temperature range in a compost pile.\nModels of Composting\nComposting can take place at a range of scales and locations. Site and facility management can be public, private, or a combination. Materials arrive at composting sites through different collection programs.\nThe fundamentals of composting are the same no matter the size or scale of an operation. However, the volume of materials composted, the types of feedstock, and the composting methods and equipment used may differ. Composting operations that handle large volumes of materials and certain feedstocks - such as biosolids or manures - may have additional permitting or zoning requirements, depending on state and local regulations.\n\nBackyard/Home Composting\nBackyard/home composting occurs in residential settings \u2013 often in a backyard pile or a small, enclosed bin. Vermicomposting, or worm composting, is also an option for home composters. Home composting systems mostly handle food scraps (except for meat, bones, and dairy products) and yard trimmings. By composting at home, households reduce their trash going to the landfill or incinerator and use the compost they produce in their garden, yard, or house plants. To learn more, visit EPA\u2019s Home Composting webpage.\nCommunity Composting", "title": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA", "score": 20.059837, "feedback": {"relevant": {"e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1725427209}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "bin for compost temperature"}}}}}}}, {"document_id": "41168a49b304126a-13272-15299", "text": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA\nWindrows are the most common method of composting in the United States. Windrows can be turned periodically or have perforated pipes underneath them to allow air flow. Small to large volumes and a wide variety of materials can be composted using this method, which makes it adaptable to many scales and sites for composting. Windrow composting often requires equipment such as front-end loaders, excavators, or windrow turners.\nIn-Vessel\nIn-vessel composting can process a variety of organic materials without taking up much space. This method involves feeding materials into a vessel, such as a drum, silo, concrete-lined trench, or similar enclosed equipment. The materials are then mechanically turned or mixed in the vessel with bulking agents like wood chips to ensure aeration. Vessels, also known as bioreactors, vary in size and capacity. A similar composting method that takes place in an enclosed area is an agitated bay system where mixing and aerating equipment moves compost along walled bays or beds as it decomposes and stabilizes.\nWorm Composting (Vermicomposting)\n\n Resources\n \n\nCheck out EPA\u2019s Home Composting page as well as vermicomposting resources from North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension.\n\nWorm composting, or vermicomposting, relies on earthworms and microorganisms to break down organic materials into vermicompost, or worm castings, a high-quality soil amendment. A vermicomposting system can be indoors or outdoors in the shade and sized to match the volume of food scraps put into the system. Vermicomposting can used by households, schools, farms, institutions, and businesses. A properly maintained vermicomposting system does not produce odors or attract pests.\nIt is essential to use a suitable worm species, such as red wrigglers (Eisenia fetida). Worms are kept in a closed bin or system that should be shielded from light and rain, with sufficient air flow, and a way to drain excess liquid. The ideal temperature for a vermicomposting system is 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.", "title": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA", "score": 18.106525, "feedback": {"relevant": {"e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1725427212}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "bin for compost temperature"}}}}}}}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "What size should the bin be for compost?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc", "created_at": 1725425784}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "In Madison County, NY., the bin for composting should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1725425786}}, {"speaker": "user", "text": "can you please explain the steps for composting at home?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc", "created_at": 1725426638}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain the steps for composting at home as outlined by Madison County, NY. Step 1: Pick Out A Bin - The bin should be at least 3x3x3 feet in size. The location can affect how fast your compost dries out or holds water. A closed bin is recommended to keep critters out. If you use a closed bin, add a shovel full of soil from the ground. Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. Step 2: Gather Materials - Browns are higher in carbon, and greens are higher in nitrogen. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Avoid feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter. Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink. Step 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom to help with air and drainage. Layer your browns and greens, imagining you're making a bowl for your greens to lay in the middle and then adding more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung out sponge. Turning helps a pile break down faster and ensures oxygen is present. Step 4: Harvest and More! - You will know when your compost is done when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. If you do not fully turn the pile, your finished compost will be at the bottom of the pile. If you're running out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel, and toilet paper rolls make good brown additions.

You can use a service's Lite plan to build an app without incurring any charges. A Lite plan might be offered on a monthly cycle that is renewed each month or on a one-off usage basis. Lite pricing plans are available with all account types. You can have one instance of a Lite plan for each service. For more information about Lite accounts, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accountsliteaccount).\n* How many apps can I build?\n\nThere's no limit to the number of apps you can build in a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account.\n\nIf you created a Lite account before 12 August 2021, you can build and deploy apps with 256 MB of instantaneous runtime memory. To get 512 MB of free instantaneous runtime memory, upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account and pay only for what you use over that limit.\n* What happens when my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota?\n\nReaching any quota limit for Lite plan instances suspends the service for that month. Quota limits are per org, not instance. New instances that you create in the same org reflect any usage from previous instances.

Data Integrity and Long-term Data Retention: Immutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity. It ensures that data is stored in a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many), no-erasable and non-rewritable manner, which can be beneficial for industries like Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives where data integrity is crucial. \n 2. Compliance: Immutable Object Storage can help organizations comply with certain regulations like SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511(c), and CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d) that govern electronic records storage and retention. When using immutable Object Storage, it is the client's responsibility to check for and ensure whether any of the feature capabilities that are discussed can be used to satisfy and comply with the key rules around electronic records storage and retention governed by the above-mentioned regulations.\nDisadvantages:  \n1. Limited Availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only. Users outside these regions may not be able to use this feature. \n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan, which could be a disadvantage for users looking for more affordable options.  \n3. No High-speed Transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy. This could potentially slow down the data transfer process.  \n4. Irreversible: Once permanent retention is enabled, it can't be reversed. Objects uploaded that use a permanent retention period cannot be deleted. This means users need to be sure about their need to permanently store objects. \n5.

Following that coup , the Qin army marched into Yiqu territory at the queen dowager 's orders ; the Qin annihilated the Yiqu remnants and thus came to possess the Ordos region . At this point the Qin built a wall around their new territories to defend against the true nomads even further north , incorporating the Wei walls .

In the fake world, you have $100k. With this fake money, you can do reckless things with it, such as put it all on one stock.

Third, you mentioned long-term investing, but you also said that you need to make your money back quick and mentioned trading daily. Those things aren't really compatible.

The risk of losing is very much there, and you shouldn't be investing money this way that you aren't prepared to lose. If you need the money for something soon, don't put it in the stock market. Never forget this. What can happen is that you start with small amounts of money, do well, and then, thinking that you are good at this, put in larger amounts of money. You will eventually lose.

It won't return much interest, but it will return some and it is easily accessible. If you have all your emergency savings that you need (at least six months of income), buy index-based mutual funds. These should invest in a broad range of securities including both stocks and bonds (three dollars in stocks for every dollar in bonds) so as to be robust in the face of market shifts. You should not buy individual stocks unless you have enough money to buy a lot of them in different industries. Thirty different stocks is a minimum for a diversified portfolio, and you really should be looking at more like a hundred. There's also considerable research effort required to verify that the stocks are good buys. For most people, this is too much work. For most people, broad-based index funds are better purchases. You don't have as much upside, but you also are much less likely to find yourself holding worthless paper. If you do buy stocks, look for ones where you know something about them. For example, if you've been to a restaurant chain with a recent IPO that really wowed you with their food and service, consider investing. But do your research, so that you don't get caught buying after everyone else has already overbid the price. The time to buy is right before everyone else notices how great they are, not after. Some people benefit from joining investment clubs with others with similar incomes and goals. That way you can share some of the research duties. Also, you can get other opinions before buying, which can restrain risky impulse buys. Just to reiterate, I would recommend sticking to mutual funds and saving accounts for most investors. Only make the move into individual stocks if you're willing to be serious about it. There's considerable work involved. And don't forget diversification. You want to have stocks that benefit regardless of what the overall economy does. Some stocks should benefit from lower oil prices while others benefit from higher prices.

However, you have some problems with this:  When you buy stocks directly, you have to buy whole shares, and you don't have enough money to buy even one whole share of all the stocks you want to invest in. You aren't even sure which stocks you should buy. A mutual fund solves both of these problems.  You get together with other investors and pool your money together to buy a group of stocks.  That way, your investment is diversified in lots of different stocks without having to have enough money to buy whole shares of each one.  And the mutual fund has a manager that chooses which stocks the fund will invest in, so you don't have to pick. There are lots of mutual funds to choose from, with as many different objectives as you can imagine.

You don't open a mutual fund, you invest in it. There's a minimum required investment ($2000? Could be, some funds have lower limits, you don't have to go with the Fidelity one necessarily), but in general it has nothing to do with your Roth IRA account. You can invest in mutual funds with any trading account, not just Roth IRA (or any other specific kind). If you invest in ETF's  - you can invest in funds just as well (subject to the minimums set). As to the plan itself - buying and selling ETF's will cost you commission, ~2-3% of your investment. Over several months, you may get positive returns, and may get negative returns, but keep in mind that you start with the 2-3% loss on day 1. Within a short period of time, especially in the current economic climate (which is very unstable - just out of recession, election year, etc etc), I would think that keeping the cash in a savings account would be a better choice. While with ETF you don't have any guarantees other than -3%, then with savings accounts you can at least have a guaranteed return of ~1% APY (i.e.: won't earn much over the course of your internship, but you'll keep your money safe for your long term investment). For the long term - the fluctuations of month to month don't matter much, so investing now for the next 50 years - you shouldn't care about the stock market going 10% in April. So, keep your 1000 in savings account, and if you want to invest 5000 in your Roth IRA - invest it then.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Container Registry provides a multi-tenant, highly available, scalable, and encrypted private image registry that is hosted and managed by IBM\u00ae. You can use Container Registry by setting up your own image namespace and pushing container images to your namespace. This service is required if using Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Object Storage \n\n[Object Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-about-cloud-object-storage) stores encrypted and dispersed data across multiple geographic locations. Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "score": 19.19652, "feedback": {"relevant": {"e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1724899463}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry"}}}}}}}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "Does Vulnerability Advisor scan encrypted imagery?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc", "created_at": 1724893077}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "No, encrypted images are not scanned by Vulnerability Advisor.", "metadata": {"author_type": "model", "author_id": "mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01", "created_at": 1724893078}}, {"speaker": "user", "text": "Then what does Vulnerability Advisor scan? what does it actually do?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc", "created_at": 1724893179}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "Vulnerability Advisor scans images that are stored in IBM Cloud Container Registry to find potential security vulnerabilities in the image content.

Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step.

Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 5\u00a0percent plus inflation in a year, or 10\u00a0percent, whichever is lower. This applies to most housing that is more than 15 years old.

The first-time home buyer program was originally limited to households of\r\nlow-income. Few households of this income level, however, are in the position of purchasing homes. Thus, this program was expanded to include moderate-income households.\n\nAs of September 2000, home buyers in 22 counties had received funding from the state. Four counties\u2014Fresno, Kern, Riverside, and Tulare\u2014represent more than 60 percent of the\r\nsingle-family programs' expenditures. The concentration of applicants in the Central Valley should not be particularly surprising, given that this area is one of California's fastest growing housing\r\nmarkets and often relies on the use of developer fees to finance new school construction.\nMultifamily Program. Likewise, the multifamily housing program has had limited success in funding applicants. From its allocation of $32.5 million so far, seven projects have been funded for\r\na total of $1.1 million, and another 34 projects have been approved with expected expenditures of $3.7 million. Due to the complexities of multifamily affordable housing financing and\r\nconstruction, the program takes a particularly long time to move from initial application to finished construction\u2014typically a minimum of one year.\nConcerns About the Programs \nOur review of these housing assistance programs indicates a number of concerns with their operation, which we discuss below.\nLack of Applications Threatens Viability of Programs. Without a dramatic expansion in home buyer and multifamily developer interest in the programs, the programs will continue to be an\r\nineffective effort to increase housing affordability. So far, CHFA has limited its marketing efforts primarily to the real estate industry, such as lenders, brokers, and real estate agents.

It is responsible for keeping our feet on the ground and holding Earth in its orbit around the Sun.According to the general theory of relativity, gravity can be understood as bends and curves in the fabric of space-time that affect the motions of galaxies, stars, planets, and even light. Anything with mass makes a dent in space-time, causing objects to be attracted to each other.Gravity is an attractive force that draws two objects together. Its strength approximately increases with the masses of the two objects but decreases with the square of the distance between them. That means that if the Moon were twice its current distance from Earth, the gravitational tug between the two would be just one fourth of what it is now.Despite being the weakest force, gravity works across infinite distances, making it responsible for the formation of the universe's structure.Electromagnetic ForceNASAOur television sets are powered by electromagnetism. Light carries this force, which illuminates our houses at night, keeps electrons in orbit around atomic nuclei, and allows chemical compounds to form.As the name implies, electromagnetism is the force that includes both electricity and magnetism. They are intertwined \u2014 a moving electric field produces a magnetic field, and vice versa.Like gravity, the strength of electromagnetism drops off with the square of the distance between objects and works at infinite range. However, electromagnetism only comes into play for charged objects, and whether it attracts or repels depends on the charges of each. Two negative or positive charges repel each other; one of each attracts.While electromagnetism is stronger than gravity, it is often balanced out in large objects by the equal numbers of positive and negative charges that form neutral atoms. For example, Earth has a magnetic field due to electric currents in its liquid core; however, Earth itself is electrically neutral.Strong Nuclear ForceNASANuclear forces affect our daily lives, but they work on distances smaller than atoms.The strong nuclear force, or strong force for short, holds together the building blocks of atoms.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.", "score": 13.712833, "feedback": {"relevant": {"e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1724723712}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "charges vary depending on the resources that are used by a particular service"}}}}}}}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-1672-3956", "text": "\nServices For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume.

Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged. \n Tiered In this pricing model, you get a volumed-based discount according to your actual usage. Tiered pricing is typically used for charge metrics that are expected to have high quantities per month, such as API calls. Services might offer simple, graduated, or block tier pricing plans. Services For API Connect, one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter. \n Reserved Reserved pricing is based on a long-term commitment for a service, so you can get a discounted price. With a reserved plan, you get a dedicated service instance that is easy to set up, deploy, and deliver in the public IBM Cloud environment. Services Db2 on Cloud has reserved plans. \n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding monthly and hourly tags \n\nOn the usage dashboard, your products and resources can be labeled with Monthly, Hourly, or a combination of both tags to signify how often charges are updated.\n\nThe Monthly tag signifies that resources within your account have a fixed cost. These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis. The following list provides some examples of Lite plan quotas:\n\n\n\n* Maximum number of registered devices\n* Maximum number of application bindings", "score": 13.6616535, "feedback": {"relevant": {"e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1724723532}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "charges vary depending on the resources that are used by a particular service"}}}}}}}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03729-4932-7001", "text": "\nFor example, consider a runtime that costs $0.07 per GB-hour in two 512-MB instances, running for 30 days (720 hours). These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances. Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs. If a reserved plan is available, click Request, and follow the prompts to send your request. You receive an email that contains the price information of the reserved plan. An IBM Cloud sales representative also contacts you soon to complete the purchase.\n\nTiered charges\n: Similar to metered charges, you pay based on your runtime and service consumption. However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into.

The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. An example of this type of charge is the fixed plans for Bare Metal Servers.\n2. Metered: Metered usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. An example of this type of charge is the Push service, where any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n3. Tiered: Tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block. In the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier. An example of this type of charge is the API Connect service, where one of the tiered plans charges $10,000 for the first 25 million monthly API calls and $40.00 USD per 100,000 API calls per month thereafter.\n4.

For example, people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for encephalitis (swelling of the brain).What are the symptoms of a West Nile virus infection?No Symptoms in Most PeopleMost people (70-80%) who become infected with West Nile virus do not have any symptoms.Fever in Some PeopleAbout 1 in 5 people who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this type of West Nile virus recover completely, but feeling tired and weak can last for weeks to months.Severe Symptoms in a Few PeopleLess than 1% of people who are infected will develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord). The symptoms of neurologic illness can include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, seizures, or paralysis.

Of those, over 20,000 people have had infections of the brain or spinal cord and more than 1,900 people have died.

Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?", "title": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n", "score": 11.841277, "feedback": {"relevant": {"479c97b6-b7f2-477b-a397-a075fc27a151": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723739328}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "animal infect disease"}}}}}}}, {"document_id": "dd2c94212064f84d-10973-13089", "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\n(e) finished taxidermy mounts with no meat or tissue attached (antlers in the velvet stage are allowed if no meat, brain or other tissue is attached).\n(f) upper canine teeth (buglers, whistlers, ivories).\n\nBasically, \u201cno skull, no backbone\u201d to avoid importing the highest risk tissues for carrying prion.\nBest practice and best recommendation is to only bring back packaged meat and/or finished taxidermy mounts.\n\nI harvested an animal out of state but didn\u2019t get it tested, can CDFW test the meat for me?\n\nCDFW cannot test \u201cmeat\u201d for CWD. While it is possible to test for and detect CWD prions in meat and other tissues, these tests are currently only available in specialized research labs and not for diagnostic or consumer use.\u00a0\nThere is no \u201cmeat safety\u201d test for CWD. For current testing options, results are reported as \u201cDetected\u201d or \u201cNot Detected\u201d for CWD and other prion diseases. That means we can be certain an animal is positive for CWD if the prions are \u201cdetected\u201d but we cannot be certain the animal did not have CWD if the results are \u201cnot detected.\u201d This is one of the major issues surrounding CWD and other prion diseases and is in large part because of the attributes of the pathogen itself (the prion) and the sensitivities of the currently available tests\u00a0\nFurthermore, if you brought back only the parts allowed by \u00a0CCR Title 14, Section 712 regulations, then the samples needed to perform an official CWD test are not available.
